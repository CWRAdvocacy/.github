# Center for Women's Rights Advocacy

The Center for Womenâ€™s Rights and Advocacy (CWRA) is a non-profit organisation that seeks to promote gender equality by challenging harmful cultural practices and institutional norms at the root of all forms of violence against women and girls.

We envision a society where women and girls live their lives free of violence from public or private sources, so as to enjoy equal opportunities in social, economic, cultural, civil and political life.
